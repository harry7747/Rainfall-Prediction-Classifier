# Rainfall Prediction Classifier Model: Project README

## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating a machine learning model for a classification task. The primary objective is to accurately predict outcomes based on a given set of features. The repository contains the complete workflow, from initial data exploration and feature selection to model training, evaluation, and interpretation. A secondary goal was to use unsupervised learning to discover any inherent structures within the data.

## 2. Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning lifecycle, broken down into the following key stages:

#### a. Data Exploration & Feature Selection
The initial phase involved a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics.
* **Correlation Analysis:** A correlation matrix was generated to identify linear relationships between variables and the target outcome. This helped in understanding multicollinearity and identifying potentially strong predictors.
* **Feature Importance:** Tree-based models, specifically a Random Forest classifier, were used to calculate and rank feature importances. This provided a model-based view of which features contributed most significantly to the predictive power.

#### b. Model Development & Training
Several supervised learning algorithms were implemented to find the best-performing model for this classification problem. The models were chosen to represent different approaches to classification:
* **Logistic Regression:** Implemented as a baseline linear model.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric, instance-based learning model.
* **Decision Tree:** A simple tree-based model to capture non-linear patterns.
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble model to improve upon the Decision Tree by reducing variance and improving accuracy.

#### c. Performance Evaluation
Model performance was not judged on accuracy alone. A more nuanced evaluation was conducted to understand the model's behavior and error types.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Generated for each model to visualize performance.
* **Key Metrics:**
    * **Precision:** To measure the accuracy of positive predictions (minimize false positives).
    * **Recall (Sensitivity):** To measure the model's ability to identify all actual positives (minimize false negatives).
    * **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single score that balances both metrics.

#### d. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Analysis
To further explore the dataset, an unsupervised learning approach was applied.
* **Algorithm:** A clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) was used to segment the data into distinct groups without using pre-labeled outcomes.
* **Optimal Cluster Selection:** The **Silhouette Score** was calculated for a range of cluster numbers to determine the optimal `k` value, ensuring the resulting clusters were dense and well-separated.
